Welcome to this Monopoly simulator. The purpose of this simulator is to<br>
evaluate the effectiveness of teaching artificial intelligence to play the<br>
game of Monopoly. You the Human player will be competing against three other<br>
computer players that are guided by artificial intelligence.<br><br>
<p>
After the game is complete, you will be asked to email a results file to<br>
the author so that the ability of the AI players can be evaluated. Please<br>
email those results when asked to do so.<br><br>
