Welcome to this Monopoly simulator. The purpose of this simulator is to 
evaluate the effectiveness of teaching artificial intelligence to play the 
game of Monopoly. You, the Human player, will be competing against three other 
computer players that are guided by artificial intelligence.  
<p>
After the game is complete, you will be asked to email a results file to 
the author so that the ability of the AI players can be evaluated. Please 
email those results when asked to do so.
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please send an email to gamonopoly@gmail.com.
