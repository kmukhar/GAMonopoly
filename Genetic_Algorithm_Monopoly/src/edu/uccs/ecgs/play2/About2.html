Welcome to this Monopoly simulator. The purpose of this simulator was to<br> 
evaluate the effectiveness of teaching artificial intelligence to play the<br>
game of Monopoly. That research has now concluded. You can still use this<br>
simulator to compete against three other computer players that are guided by <br>
artificial intelligence. However, since the research is complete, you are <br>
encouraged to play Monopoly online at Pogo.com (see the link below).<br><br>
<p>
The Monopoly game, all its rules, images, names, etc. are Copyright by the<br>
Hasbro corporation. My use of various names and images in the simulator are<br>
being used for research purposes, and thus I believe that this falls under<br>
the fair use exception to copyright. Please do not use this simulator in <br>
place of licensed on-line versions of the game.<br><br>
