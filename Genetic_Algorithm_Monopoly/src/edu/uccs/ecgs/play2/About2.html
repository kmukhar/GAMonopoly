Welcome to this Monopoly simulator. The purpose of this simulator was to 
evaluate the effectiveness of teaching artificial intelligence to play the 
game of Monopoly. That research has now concluded. You can still use this 
simulator to compete against three other computer players that are guided by  
artificial intelligence. However, since the research is complete, you are 
encouraged to play Monopoly online at Pogo.com (see the link below), or to buy 
a digital version of the game for your favorite platform. There are links at 
the end of the game that you can use to buy the game.

The Monopoly game, all its rules, images, names, etc. are Copyright by the 
Hasbro corporation. My use of various names and images in the simulator are 
being used for research purposes, and thus I believe that this falls under 
the fair use exception to copyright. Please do not use this simulator in 
place of licensed on-line versions of the game.
