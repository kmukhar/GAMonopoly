 * Compute fitness based on the finish order for the player. For each first
 * place finish in a game, the player is awarded a score that is the number of
 * players in a game minus 1 (e.g. if there are 4 players in a game, the score
 * for a win is 3). Given the number of players n, then 2nd place gets n-2
 * points; 3rd place gets n-3 points; etc. Last place in a game gets 0 points.
