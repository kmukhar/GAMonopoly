MONOPOLY BRAND HISTORY:\

\f1\b0 \cf0 \
If you want to understand the spirit of the MONOPOLY brand, look no further than its creator.\
Charles B. Darrow was one of many unemployed Americans who lived during the Great Depression. Life was bleak, but Darrow had a big idea: a game that would let everyone enjoy a taste of the high life.\
In 1934 he took his game to Parker Brothers but they rejected it because it didn\'d5t meet their standards.\
Not a man to quit at the first obstacle, Darrow made a deal with a local printer and had 5000 sets made, which he sold to a Philadelphia department store.\
People loved the game and news of its success soon got back to Parker Brothers. They negotiated a deal and, as a result, both their fortunes were made.\
Today MONOPOLY is still the world\'d5s number \uc0\u8232 one board game.\
